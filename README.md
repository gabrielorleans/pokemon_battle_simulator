# Pokémon Battle Simulator (Under development) 🚀⚡  

*A data-driven simulator to determine the strongest Pokémon in 1v1 battles through statistical analysis and machine learning.*  

---

## **Project Overview**  
This repository hosts a **Pokémon Battle Simulator** that:  
✅ Simulates 1v1 battles across all generations  
✅ Analyzes battle outcomes to rank Pokémon statistically  
✅ Identifies key factors (stats, types, moves) that influence wins  
✅ Generates insights like "Which stat matters most?" or "Best type combinations?"  

---

## **Key Features**  
- **Battle Engine**: Simulates turn-based battles with type effectiveness, stats, and moves.  
- **Data Integration**: Uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokémon stats, moves, and learnsets.  
- **Statistical Analysis**:  
  - 📊 **Win Correlation**: Which stat (Attack/HP/Speed) most impacts victories?  
  - 🔥 **Type Dominance**: Are Dragon/Steel types truly the best? How do Fairy types fare?  
  - 🎯 **Move Effectiveness**: Are high-power moves always better? How does accuracy affect outcomes?  
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps of type matchups, win-rate distributions, and more.

## **Example Research Questions**  
1. **Stats Analysis**:  
   - *Does Speed dominate 1v1 battles?*  
   - *Is Defense more important than Attack?*  
2. **Type Meta**:  
   - *Which dual-type combinations have the highest win rates?*  
3. **Move Impact**:  
   - *Do recoil moves (e.g., Flare Blitz) hurt longevity despite high damage?*  
   - *How often do status moves (e.g., Toxic) decide battles?*  
4. **Generational Trends**:  
   - *Are Gen 1 Pokémon inherently weaker than Gen 9?*

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Python**: Core simulation logic.  
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data processing and analysis.  
- **Plotly/Seaborn**: Visualizations.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis.

### **Near-Future Next Features**  

#### **Battle Simulation Enhancements**  
- **Single Battle Simulator**: Run 1v1 battles with customizable Pokémon and movesets.  
- **AI Move Selection**: Implement decision-making logic for Pokémon to choose optimal moves (e.g., highest damage, status utility).  
- **Advanced Move Effects**:  
  - Status conditions (burn, paralysis, sleep).  
  - Stat boosts/drops (Swords Dance, Screech).  
  - Secondary effects (recoil, flinch, life steal).  
- **Battle Mechanics**:  
  - Accuracy/evasion checks.  
  - Critical hits.  
  - Move priority (e.g., Quick Attack vs. Tackle).  

#### **Additional Ideas**  
1. **Team Builder Analysis**: Test how specific Pokémon pairs (e.g., tank + sweeper) perform in simulated battles.  
2. **Meta Trends Over Time**: Compare battle outcomes across different generations (Gen 1 vs. Gen 9 power creep).

## **Future Ideas**  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Predict battle outcomes using Pokémon stats/moves.  
- 🌐 **Web App**: Interactive simulator with real-time stats.  
- 🏆 **Tier Lists**: Generate data-backed tier rankings for competitive play.
